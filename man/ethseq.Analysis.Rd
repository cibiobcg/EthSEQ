\arguments{
\item{target.vcf}{Path to the sample's genotypes in VCF format}

\item{target.gds}{Path to the sample's genotypes in GDS format}

\item{bam.list}{Path to a file containing a list of BAM files paths}

\item{out.dir}{Path to the folder where the output of the analysis is saved}

\item{model.gds}{Path to a GDS file specifying the reference model}

\item{model.available}{String specifying the pre-computed reference model to use (SS2, SS2.Light, SS4, SS4.Light, NimblegenV3, NimblegenV3.Light, HALO, HALO.Light, Exonic). Models with postfix .Light are built with less reference samples and are indicated when RAM availability is limited.}

\item{model.folder}{Path to the folder where reference models are already present or downloaded when needed}

\item{run.genotype}{Logical values indicating whether the ASEQ genotype should be run}

\item{aseq.path}{Path to the folder where ASEQ binary is available or is downloaded when needed}

\item{mbq}{Minimum base quality used in the pileup by ASEQ}

\item{mrq}{Minimum read quality used in the piluep by ASEQ}

\item{mdc}{Minimum read count acceptable for genotype inference by ASEQ}

\item{cores}{Number of parallel cores used for the analysis}

\item{verbose}{Print computation details}

\item{composite.model.call.rate}{SNPs call rate used to run Principal Component Analysis (PCA)}

\item{refinement.analysis}{Matrix specyfing a tree of ethnicities}
\item{space}{Dimensions of PCA space used to infer ethnicity. Value 2D is for using first two PCA components, while value 3D is for using the first three PCA components.}
}
\value{
Logical value indicating the success of the analysis
}
\description{
This function performs ethnicity analysis of a set of samples from a list of BAM files or genotype data in VCF format ad reports the results.

\examples{

out.dir = file.path(tempdir(),"EthSEQ_Analysis/")

## Run the analysis
ethseq.Analysis(
  target.vcf = system.file("extdata", "Samples_SS2_10000SNPs.vcf",
	package="EthSEQ"),
  out.dir = out.dir,
  model.gds = system.file("extdata", "Reference_SS2_10000SNPs.gds",
	package="EthSEQ"),
  verbose=TRUE,
  composite.model.call.rate = 1,
  space="3D") # Default space is 2D

## Load and display computed ethnicity annotations
ethseq.annotations = read.delim(file.path(out.dir,"Report.txt"),
	sep="\t",as.is=TRUE,header=TRUE)
head(ethseq.annotations)

## Delete analysis folder
unlink(out.dir,recursive=TRUE)
